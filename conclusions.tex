\section{Summary of Results and Significance}

\section{Recommendations for Future Research}

Although this thesis proposed methodologies that starts right from the
beginning, compiling data, processing data \ldots step by step to analyze results,
and finally found and validated an approach to make a reliable paleomagnetic
APWP, there are still many further studies that need to be done.
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item As mentioned in the objectives of Chapter~\ref{chap:Intro}, we have
  investigated the limits of paleomagnetic data on reconstructing individual
  plate motions like of North America, India and Australia in
  Chapter~\ref{chap:Reliab}. We still need to further investigate the limits of
  paleomagnetic data on reconstructing supercontinents, and even global tectonic
  parameters like average rate of plate motion, number of plates and so on.
  \item 
\end{enumerate}
