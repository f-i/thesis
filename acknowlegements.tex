I thank Dr Daniel Holm for reaching out every time when I need help. I also
  thank him for helping me finish the final polishing of this thesis. I
  especially thank him and Ms Kelly Thomasson for helping me get a parking
  permission when I was temperally disabled in the snowy winter of 2018.

I thank Dr Chris Rowan for advising me on this topic and his detailed feedback
  for my writing.

I thank Dr Joseph Ortiz for encouraging me to compelete a small fun project
  ``What if The Himalayas Doesn't Exist'' in his Paleoceanography class. When I
  was not very confident about my speaking and writing at the beginning of this
  graduate program, he said ``I couldn't imagine how terrible I do if I study in
  China.'' He is a gentleman.

I also want to thank my parents and sister for their unconditional support. My
  dad got a bad cancer early last year, immediately had a major surgery and is
  still doing chemotherapy. My mom and sister take care of him all the time and
  I didn't go home yet since then.

The similarity measuring tool developed in this thesis depends on the
  open-source softwares PmagPy~\citep{T16} and GMT~\citep{W13}. All images are
  produced using GMT\@.

Thanks to Ohio Supercomputer Center for their remote HPC resources.
