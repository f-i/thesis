\chapter{How Much Data Needed to Make a Reliable APWP}\label{chap:DatNeed}
\textit{This chapter mainly describes how the mean poles with their original
paleopoles at random reduced densities can make a reliable APWP\@. Further we
will see how much data (raw paleopoles) are needed on earth to make a reliable
APWP, and how the ``bad'' paleopoles influence the final result when we have
less data. Are we be able to make a final determination of best number of
paleopoles in each sliding window in average for moving-averaging out an APWP\@?
(No, different situations for different continents.)}

\minitoc\newpage

In the past, especially in deep time, the density and quality of paleomagnetic
data are lower, compared with younger geological times. Reducing the data
density for relatively younger geological times (for example, ${\sim}120$\textendash0
Ma) can help see if our methodology is still able to reliably give reasonable
results from data aged in deep times (for example, geological times that are
older than ${\sim}120$ Ma, even to the Precambrian times or older).

\section{Reference Path}

The fixed hotspot model (FHM) and related plate circuit predicted APWPs are used
as references. In fact, as mentioned in the last chapter, whether we choose FHM
or whether we pick MHM as reference, they do not make much difference at all.

\section{Extration Fraction}

Sub-sampling (extracting part of raw paleopoles) is implemented before
moving-averaging with filtering/correcting and weighting at four discrete
percentages, 80\%, 60\%, 40\% and 20\%, which mean respectively 20, 40, 60 and
80 per cent of raw paleopoles are removed. This means not all sub-samples at,
for example, 80\% are going to be used to generate a path from the same number
of paleopoles after filtering. In some cases a large number might be removed, in
others much less, depending on the properties of the sub-sampled population.
This is definitely an additional factor that would affect the difference score.

\end{figure}

We can see that the best picking and weighting methods are statistically always
better than the worst ones even if only 20 percent of thei 120\textendash0 Ma
paleopoles are used to compose the APWPs (Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw} and
Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw_res}) for the three continents, North America, India
and Australia.

For the worst methods applied onto Indian and Australian data, the equal-weight
$\mathcal{CPD}$ surprisingly decreases when the percentage of extracted data
decreases (Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw}). This is because after the data density
is reduced the left data are not always enough to cover all the time range of
120\textendash0 Ma but only part, or even though the 120 and 0 Ma mean poles
(two ends) exist, the number of intermediate mean poles between 120 Ma and 0 Ma
is much less than the APWP from data without reducing density
(Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw_res}).

\subsection{Number of Samples}
Here because the thousands of times of testing for each representative
percentage of data removal and also even further for each picking and weighting
method is rather expensive, only 30 samples~\citep[a rule of thumb; e.g.][says
``greater than 25 or 30'']{H19} are obtained for each percentage and method. In
fact, the 25th percentiles ($Q_1$), 75th percentiles ($Q_3$) and the means of
30, 60, 100, 200 and 1000 samples are not quite different
(Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5_0_0}), although 200 seems a better and relatively
cheaper option.

\subsection{Extreme Value Study: Suggestions on Algorithm, especially on large
uncertainties}

It seems rational for us to agree on that less paleomagnetic data tends to bring
poorer similarity between paleomagnetic APWPs and the reference path. However,
it is noticeable that even though the data density is tremendously reduced
(e.g.\ by 80\%), it seems still possible to have a better similarity score for
paleomagnetic APWPs and the reference, sometimes even better than for the
paleomagnetic APWP with all original number of datasets (e.g.\ the
black-outlined rings in Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw}). For example, for the case
(a) (Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw}), even though 60\% of the paleopoles are
removed, we still can get a better similarity score (here, 0) using the
paleomagnetic APWP composed of the left 40\% of the paleopoles than the
original. Although this 40\% data generated paleomagnetic APWP owns the same
number of mean poles as the 100\% data generated paleomagnetic APWP, the average
number of paleopoles for each mean pole is obviously much less. The main reason
why this 40\% data generated paleomagnetic APWP is more similar to the reference
path is that this APWP's spatial uncertainties (FQ: C-A) are much larger than
those (FQ: B-A) of the 100\% data generated paleomagnetic APWP
(Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5b101l40p_vs_100p}). Even only 20\% of the paleopoles
could also give a better similarity (the lowest yellow dot in
Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw} (a)). Unfortunately, the reason why this 20\% data
generated paleomagnetic APWP is more similar to the reference path is the same
as for the 40\% data generated path: extremely large spatial uncertainties (FQ:
C-A). So we need to be cautious about the similarity score when we do not have
enough paleomagnetic data for making an APWP, which tends to generate large
spatial uncertainties for mean poles. The situation is the same for the lowest
difference given by the 20\% North American paleomagnetic data with the worst
method 16(2) applied (the lowest yellow dot in Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw}(b)).

\end{figure*}

Further for the case (b) (Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw}), the main reason why the
only 20\% data could give a better result than the 100\% data does is that not
only, for example, for the lowest yellow dot the 20\% data gives less mean
poles, but also a few extremely large spatial uncertainties appear for this
20\% case (Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5w101l20p_vs_100p}). The same situation
happens to the green dot case (Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw} (f)).

\end{figure*}

For the case (c) (Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw}), the reason why the 80\% data is
able to give a better result than the 100\% data does is that the 10 Ma mean
pole of the 80\% data derived path is a bit closer to reference, because both
the 10 Ma pole pair in Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5b501l80p_vs_100p} are
distinguishable. Although the 80\% data derived paleomagnetic APWP
(Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5b501l80p}) generally owns relatively larger spatial
uncertainties, the related pole pairs are distinguishable for both path pairs in
Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5b501l80p_vs_100p}.

Still for the case (c) (Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw}), of the 30 samples for the
20\% data, none is able to give better result compared with the 100\% data, but
the lowest difference value we can get from these 30 samples (20\% in
Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw} (c)) indicates that even 20\% data is still able to
give good (not dramatically different from that 100\% data gives) similarity
(Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5b501l20p}).

For the case (d) (Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw}), the reason why the only 40\%
data could give a better result than the 100\% data does is that for the yellow
dot (Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw} (d)) not only the 40\% data gives less mean
poles (but two ends 120 Ma and 0 Ma still exist), but also the 40\% data does
not contain some ``bad'' paleopoles that are far away from the reference path
(Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5w501l40p}). It's the same for the lowest difference
given by the 20\% data samples (the green dot in Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw}
(d)).

For the case (e) (Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw}), although the 20\% data derived
paleomagnetic paths are not closer to the reference path than the 100\% data
derived one, the closest one (the lowest yellow dot along the 20\% grid line in
Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw} (e)) still performs quite well
(Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5b801l20p}). This is mainly because the number of mean
poles is still the same as the 100\% data generated path when there are only
20\% of the paleopoles. However, for 120, 115, 110 and 105 Ma, where the mean
poles, actually the same pole, are relatively far from the reference path for
the 20\% data (Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5b801}), the uncertainties are also
rather large (Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw} (e)).

For the case (f) (Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5bw}), most of the 20\% data derived

\subsection{Relationship between $d_s$ Score and Number of Paleopoles for
Paleomagnetic APWP}

From Table~\ref{tab-dsrole}, it is noticeable that all the $\mathcal{CPD}$s
contain contribution from $d_s$, and most of the $\mathcal{CPD}$s are actually
only from $d_s$. This indicates the key role of $d_s$ in calculating the
difference score of paleomagnetic APWP from reference path.

Then the relationship between number of paleopoles for each mean pole and $d_s$
from all the reduced-data-density experiments is investigated according to
different tectonic plates (Fig.~\ref{fig-n_ds}) and different amounts of density
reducing (Fig.~\ref{fig-n_ds2}). Based on the trends of the means of the $d_s$s,
after the number of paleopoles is more than 10, all the means of $d_s$s intend
to be stable no matter what plates (Fig.~\ref{fig-n_ds}) or how much data
density is reduced (Fig.~\ref{fig-n_ds2}), although more than 10 paleopoles make
the mean less oscillatory (when enough experiments are implemented). So it seems
that at least 10 paleopoles are needed for establishing a mean pole that is
reasonably close to ``true'' pole.

\section{Are the rules we obtained in the last chapter are still true for less
data?}

First, that if APP is still better, and weighting is still not affecting for
less dense paleomagnetic data, is needed to be tested.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{fig/Fay18_10_5_101appamp.pdf}
    \captionsetup{width=1\textwidth}
    \caption{Comparisons of results from Picking No. 1 (APP) and Picking No. 0
	(AMP) with all the listed weighting methods for three continents. The
	$Q_1$\textendash$Q_3$ interquartile range from Picking No. 1 is also shown
	(shadowed) in the plot of Picking No. 0 for clarity.}\label{Fig:Fay18_10_5_101appamp}
\end{figure}

From the perspective of checking if the $Q_1$\textendash$Q_3$ intervals overlap,
APP is indeed still better than AMP and weighting is indeed still not affecting
for more than 15 paleopoles making a 10/5 Myr bin/step APWP (ideally composed of
25 mean poles for 120\textendash0 Ma). For the 20\% Indian data case, which
contains not more than 15 paleopoles making a 120\textendash0 Ma APWP, there is
overlapping between APP's Mean\textendash$Q_3$ interval and AMP's
$Q_1$\textendash{}Mean interval for weighted cases (i.e.\ for Weighting No.
1\textendash5). Even so, APP's means are still lower than AMP's for this
no-more-than-15-paleopoles case (Fig.~\ref{Fig:Fay18_10_5_101appamp}). So here
is the question: is 15 the threshold?
